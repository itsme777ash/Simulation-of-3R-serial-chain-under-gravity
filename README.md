# Simulation-of-3R-serial-chain-under-gravity

This repository contains the dynamic simulation of a 3R serial chain manipulator under gravity which was done as a project for course MCL-745: Robotics.  
I**NE_Algo_3R.mlx** - Simulation using Recursive Newton-Euler algorithm(DeNOC).  
The results can be seen in **Results.pdf** and the animation in **animation.gif**
